# Mobile Flashcards
_final project of the Udacity React Nanodegree_

This is an example of using React-Native to create a flashcard application.

## INSTALLATION

_Note that you will need to have the [Expo app](https://expo.io) installed on your device or emulator to run this app._

Due to bugs with npm v.5.x this project has only ever been installed and run using yarn. If you decide to use npm your mileage may vary.

*Quick Start*

* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`

If you run into issues or would like more control, refer to the [Bootrap](./BOOTSTRAP.md) file included with this package.
The app was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) so it inherits all 
features that come with it.

## USAGE

The `yarn start` command will bring up a QR code on your screen. The Expo app will allow you to scan this QR code in order to 
launch the app.

This app was built to strict guidelines outlined by a rubric from the course. You can add new decks, take quizzes and see
your score. The navigation is self-explanitory.

## TODO

There is currently no support for removing a deck or card.

## CONTRIBUTING

You are welcome to fork this repository, however contributions will not be accepted as it is part of a class.

## THANKS

Thanks to Udacity for supplying the course and for their course on writing readme files which was used to create this one.
